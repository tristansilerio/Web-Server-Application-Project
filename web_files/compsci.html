	  <p>Computer science is a big place. Here's a woefully incomplete sampling of its many varied and surprising rooms
	  we don't get the chance to visit much at Holy Cross...</p>

	  <h5>Security + Distributed Systems</h5>

	  <p>Besides teaching me how to think and to write, and showing me the meaning of style, <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/">Fred Schneider</a> managed to find time to teach me what <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf">state machines</a> have to to with security and
	  it means for a <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/TrustSurvey.pdf"> distributed system to be
		  secure</a>. <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/LangBasedCase.pdf">languages based</a>
	  security meshes with all of this too, of course. Fred is also good at reminding me of the value to be found in <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/leastPrivNeedham.pdf">classic work</a>.

      <h5>Information + Networks</h5>
	  <p>As a grad student, I took <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/">Jon Kleinberg</a>'s course on <a
			  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs6850/">the structure of information networks</a>, where I
		  learned a lot about <a href="http://www.judithkleinfeld.com/ar_bigworld.html">small worlds</a> and <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/icm06-swn.pdf">what that means for searching</a>, the structure
	  of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/papers/2003/cacm03.pdf">peer-to-peer networks</a>, and all things
	  graphs.
		  Jon and David Easley have a <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/">great book</a>
		  that covers a lot of similar stuff, and the two of them have teamed up with <a
			  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/eva/eva.html">Éva Tardos</a> to create an on-line <a
			  href="https://www.edx.org/course/cornellx/cornellx-info2040x-networks-crowds-1354">EdX course on the same
		  topics</a>. If that course is even a fraction as interesting as Jon's live networks course, it is absolutely
	  worth checking out.
	
	  <h5>Knowledge + Uncertainty + Reasoning + Decisions</h5>

	  <p>Long ago, <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/">Joe Halpern</a> was my undergraduate advisor, and
	  I've had the good fortune of hearing him speak on a huge variety of topics since then. Joe tackles some of the really
	  fundamental questions, stuff that underlies not just computer science, but economics, philosophy, economics, the nature
	  of intelligence and, well, pretty much everything: <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/knowledge_survey.pdf">what is knowledge and how do we
		  reason about it</a>; how do we <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/iccs.pdf">reason in the
		  face of uncertainty</a>; and what is the relationship between <a
		  href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/cheathus.pdf">knowledge and action</a>.

	  <!-- <h5>Game Theory + Algorithms</h5>

	  <p><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/eva/eva.html">Éva Tardos</a> taught me 
	  <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/CS6840/2014sp/">algorithms and game theory</a>.

	  <h5>Theory of Computation</h5>

	  <p>All I know about the theory of computation comes from <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/">Dexter
		  Kozen</a>, who taught me when I was an undergrad.
	  -->

	  <h5>Big Data + Distributed Systems</h5>

	  <p><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hweather/">Hakim Weatherspoon</a> works on big distributed and networked
	  systems with lots of data. 
		  Although I brush the surface of distributed systems a bit in <a
		  href="http://mathcs.holycross.edu/~kwalsh/networks/">my networks class</a>, and Prof. King recently offered a
	  course on data mining, the systems Hakim deals with are much bigger and use lots of neat techniques for 
	  storing data on <a href="http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/pdf/fast2003-pond.pdf">lots of
		  cheap but uncentralized disk</a>, <a
		  href="http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/pdf/carbonite06.pdf">replicating data</a> to make
		  it reliable, and efficiently <a
			  href="http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/pdf/erasure_iptps.pdf">retrieving it</a>.

	  <h5>Languages + Security</h5>

	  <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/">Andrew Myers</a> showed me how programming languages intersect with
	  security.
	  A lot of his work deals with <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/jsac/sm-jsac03.pdf">information
		  flow</a>, how to <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/InfoFlowBelief.pdf">quantify it</a>, or how
	  we can use it as a way to <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/sosp01/spp-tr.pdf">split a program into
		  pieces</a>.
	  He's got a great <a href="http://andrumyers.wordpress.com/">blog</a> about security and language too.
